# Oxygen-White-Deck

This is a standard deck of playing cards designed by Eugene Trounev for the KDE project, and released into the public domain in 2012.

The source material was downloaded from a KDE release in SVG format in a layout designed to work with the kdegames package, and has been extensively worked and rearranged to allow for easy individual card rendering.

Eugene Trounev had released this work into the public domain, so in the same spirit these modifications are released under [CC0](https://creativecommons.org/choose/zero/).

The purpose of this work is to provide a spawnable playing card deck to be used in the game *Tabletop Simulator*.  The resulting Steam Workshop mod can be found [here](http://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=685423493).
